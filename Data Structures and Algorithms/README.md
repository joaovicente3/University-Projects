Project for the Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures curricular unit.

Created a platform that allowed the user to create bus routes, adding stops, calculating how much it costs and how long it takes for a specific ride and so on. The user was also able to remove any routes or stops he wanted and the program would recalculate time and costs, among other things, while using algorithms for sorting and dynamic memory for storaging information.
