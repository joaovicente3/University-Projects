This project belonged to the OOP curricular unit. 

In this project, I created an Excel-like spreadsheet with which the user could interact via the terminal. 
It allowed the user to create spreadsheets and use the most common excel features, like copying, pasting or adding all the values in a row of cells, for example. It also supported functions for strings, such as concatenating all the words in a group of cells into a cell selected by the user. In addition to that, the user could also search the cells by a specific value.
